As part of the PIMS Math^Industry Workshop, we analysed Housing Price Index Data from the Government
of Canada https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/7f497684-c857-4184-842c-6bc021f380f8, measured various 
metrics associated with the data including the mean and the standard deviation, and used graphing tools
to plot the data in several ways. We made use of the numpy, pandas, and mathplotlib packages and the 
data that we analysed from the registry was in a CSV file. The main file is Housing_Price_Index_PythonProject.ipynb.

The contributors to this project were Emily Korfanty, Jaeun Park, Jane Zhang, Sarah Nataj, Boya Peng,
and Brian Chan. We also thank Drs Ian Allison and David Colliander for their advices and helpful insights during the project.
